# Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral design patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other. They define the responsibilities and relationships between objects, ensuring that complex interactions are managed efficiently while promoting loose coupling.
(Ils définissent comment les objets interagissent et communiquent entre eux pour gérer efficacement les responsabilités et les relations.)
## Strategy 
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Chain of Responsibility
Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
