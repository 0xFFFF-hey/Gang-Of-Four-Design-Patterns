# Software Architecture
Software architecture is the backbone of any software system. It defines the structure, behavior, and interaction of components within a system, ensuring that the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements.
# What is Software Architecture?
Software architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system. It involves making fundamental decisions about the organization of components, their relationships, and how they interact to achieve the system's goals. 
# Key Goals of Software Architecture
  - Scalability: The system should handle growth in users, data, or functionality.
  - Maintainability: The system should be easy to modify and extend.
  - Reliability: The system should perform consistently under expected conditions.
  - Performance: The system should meet speed and efficiency requirements.
  - Security: The system should protect data and resources from unauthorized access.
  - Cost-Effectiveness: The system should optimize resource usage and reduce operational costs
